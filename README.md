Title: BIG DATA ANALYSIS WITH IBM CLOUD DATABASES

  The era of big data has transformed the way organizations collect, store, and analyze data. IBM Cloud Databases, with their robust capabilities and scalability, have become a vital asset in this data-driven landscape.IBM Cloud Databases seamlessly integrate with popular big data analysis tools and platforms like IBM Watson Studio.

Dataset : Iris Flower dataset

The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

Project Summary:
  
  I have learnt about some machine learning algorithms like regression, random forest, gradient descent.
  
  I have used DB2 service and uploaded our dataset. Some basic SQL queries are being developed for analysing the dataset.
  
  I have used Watson studio service and uploaded our dataset. With this service, we have launched in cloud pak and visualized our dataset in various charts like relationship charts, line plots, scatter plots etc.
  
  I have used watson machine learning studios for training out dataset with the maching learning models.
